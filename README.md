## üì± Mobile Phone Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict **the price range of mobile phones** based on various hardware features like battery capacity, RAM, screen resolution, camera specs, and more.

By analyzing historical data, the model classifies mobile phones into different price categories (low, medium, high, very high), assisting manufacturers and consumers in understanding the impact of technical specifications on market pricing.

### üîç What‚Äôs Inside

* **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for modeling
* **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Visual insights into feature distribution and correlations
* **Model Building**: Train classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)
* **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

### üß† Technologies Used

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas, NumPy ‚Äì for data handling
* Matplotlib, Seaborn ‚Äì for visualization
* Scikit-learn ‚Äì for machine learning models

---

### üéØ Objective

To predict the **price category** of a mobile phone using its specifications, making it easier to:

* Design cost-effective devices
* Compare feature vs price value
* Provide recommendations in e-commerce systems

Would you like me to also generate a full `README.md` for GitHub with installation steps, file structure, and model results like I did for the lung cancer project?
