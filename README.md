## 📱 Mobile Phone Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict **the price range of mobile phones** based on various hardware features like battery capacity, RAM, screen resolution, camera specs, and more.

By analyzing historical data, the model classifies mobile phones into different price categories (low, medium, high, very high), assisting manufacturers and consumers in understanding the impact of technical specifications on market pricing.
